# Mern stack chat with AI assistant

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a full-stack chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) . It features real-time messaging using **Socket.io**, AI-assisted coding support using the **Gemini API**, and an integrated **WebContainer** for **executing AI-generated code directly in the browser.**

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## API

The project uses the following APIs:

- `@webcontainer/api`: Provides a WebContainer API for running code in the browser.
- `axios`: A popular HTTP client for making API requests.
- `framer-motion`: A library for creating animations and transitions.
- `highlight.js`: A syntax highlighting library.
- `markdown-to-jsx`: A library for rendering Markdown content as React components.
- `react-router-dom`: A routing library for React applications.
- `remixicon`: A set of open-source icons.
- `socket.io-client`: A client-side library for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.

## üõ† Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Communicate instantly with other users.
- **AI Coding Assistant**: Get AI-powered coding suggestions and - - assistance via Gemini API.
- **In-Browser Code Execution:** Execute AI-generated code in a secure WebContainer, creating a virtual container in the browser.
- **Authentication:** Secure user login and registration with JWT.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Backend built to handle large numbers of users with Redis for caching.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Intuitive design for seamless interaction.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Backend

Located in the `/backend` folder, this contains the server-side code and handles:

- Authentication and authorization
- API endpoints for user and chat operations
- Integration with the Gemini API for AI assistance
- MongoDB for data storage and Redis for caching

### Frontend

Located in the `/frontend` folder, this contains the client-side application built with React. It includes:

- Pages for user registration, login, and chat
- API integration for backend communication
- State management using Context API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

**Backend**

Create a .env file in the /backend folder with the following variables:

```
PORT=
MONGO_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
```

**Frontend**

Create a .env file in the /frontend folder with the following variable:

```
VITE_API_URL=`<backend server URL>`
```

## Installation

&nbsp; 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clou-D-Walker/AI_assistant.git
cd AI_assistant
```

&nbsp; 2. **Set Up Backend**

```
cd backend
npm install
# Add .env file as per the above configuration
npm start

```

&nbsp; 3. **Set Up Frontend**

```
cd frontend
npm install
# Add .env file as per the above configuration
npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Usage

**1. Start the backend server:**

```
cd backend
npx nodemon
```

**2. Start the frontend development server:**

```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## ü§ñ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Caching:** Redis
- **AI Integration:** Gemini API
- **In-Browser Code Execution:** WebContainer

## ‚ú® Special Integration: WebContainer

This project leverages WebContainer, enabling the execution of AI-generated code directly in the browser. With this feature, users can:

- Run the code snippets generated by Gemini AI in a secure virtual container.
- Test and debug the code in real-time without requiring any external tools or local setups.
  The WebContainer integration provides a seamless development experience, making the application interactive and powerful.

## üôå Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Gemini API for powering the AI assistant.
- Inspired by modern chat applications for UI/UX design.
- Gratitude to the creators of [webcontainers.io](https://webcontainers.io/) for simplifying in-browser code execution.
